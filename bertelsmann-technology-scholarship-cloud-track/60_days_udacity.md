Day 3 [Tuesday, December 24th]

Lesson 8 - Reverting a Commit. I have started my old style of studying by taking notes while learning. It helps me a lot with understanding things once I learn them. I also managed to use GitHub Desktop to just have the GUI feeling on how things work.

I was inspired by @Sergei Cherniaev and had to follow his steps, so I created a repository for the scholarship,created a folder where I will be sharing my daily progress. I visited the link of the day shared by him again, thinking to learn more with AWS free courses to build more skills.

I am encouraging everyone to study hard, accept any opportunity as you never know what it will bring on the plate (as long as it fits your goals), follow the steps of thos you believe will take you to success, and finally do take notes as what is written will never be wasted.

Day 2 [Monday, December 23rd]

I managed to complete lesson 7 but I'll have to redo it as my results were never the same as the instructors. I use Git Bash since I started the course and want to master it first.

In merging section 5, I managed to get it done but not yet fully understanding it well. I think it's time to go back to my old way of studying by writing notes :spiral_note_pad: :lower_left_fountain_pen: and the execute to understand. I will repeat lesson 7 after completing lesson 8 in order to keep up with time :watch: as well.
I got stuck answering merging conflicts question 1 but I'll get back to it again as it consumed my time due to the mismatch results I had.

I am currently in Lesson 8, 50% of it completed. As I work full day, I am taking a pause to commute back home and might continue later on with Lesson 8. My aim is to complete it tonight.

I encourage everyone to study hard, repeat repeat repeat no matter what to get things correct and understand them well (master) them. Let's not forget to take breaks.

Day 1 [Sunday, December 22nd]

As I missed two days in a row 20th and 21st due to sickness :face_with_thermometer: (malaria), here I am back and starting from day one with my #60_days_udacity.

I went through the resources channel and found some good materials to start off with:

1. GitHub pages

2. Documentation on how contributors should work when using Git, Github, and the development workflow.

3. Bertlsmann Tech Scholarship blog

I am currently in lesson 7 trying to understand tagging.

I am encouraging everyone to keep going no matter what, and if something happens, don't hesitate to start from scratch. When I do typos I normally don't do autocorrect, I erase and start to retype. This has helped me to always feel okay starting with anything from one. Let's keep learning together.

Finally I wish everyone celebrating Christmas :mrs_claus: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. In advance also, Happy Boxing Day and Happy New Year everyone.
